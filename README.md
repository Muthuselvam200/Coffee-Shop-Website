# My-Markup42
- In this repository, I'm gonna add all the programs which i practiced while learning HTML and CSS...
- Earlier I started to design the google homepage as my goal and I changed the goal to a coffee shop webpage...
- I named the coffee shop as "Coffee palace" and added some images and other files in the HTML folder...
- During fourth commit, I almost finished my coffee palace website. It's really good to work on this again after so much time.
- When you click the homepage, It'll render a HTML form. I added my mail-id in action attribute, so the input will be sent to my mail-id when the user hits ssubmit button...
