# Coffee-Shop_Website
- In this repository, I added some pages from what I learned from HTML and CSS...
- I designed a coffee shop website from my understanding...
- I named the coffee shop as "Coffee palace"...
- When you click the homepage, It'll render a HTML form. I added my mail-id in action attribute, so the input will be sent to my mail-id once the form is submitted...
