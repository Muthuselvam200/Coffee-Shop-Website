# My-Markup42
In this repository, I'm gonna add all the programs which i practiced while learning HTML and CSS.
Earlier I started to design the google homepage as my goal and I changed the goal to a coffee shop webpage.
I named the coffee shop as "Coffee palace" and added some images and other files in the HTML folder.
I'll try to give my best, Let's see :)
During fourth commit, I almost finished my coffee palace website. It's really good to work on this again after so much time.
