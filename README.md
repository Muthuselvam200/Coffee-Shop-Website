# My-Markup42
# In this repository, I'm gonna add all the programs which i practiced while learning HTML.
# Earlier I started to design the google homepage as my goal and I changed the goal to a coffee shop webpage.
# I named the coffee shop as "Coffee palace" and added some images and other files in the HTML folder.
# I'll frequently work on this project later.
