# Coffee-Shop-Website
- In this repository, I added some pages from what I learned from HTML and CSS.
- I designed a coffee shop website from my understanding.
- I named the coffee shop "Coffee palace".
- When you click the homepage, it'll render an HTML form. I added my mail-id in the action attribute, so the input will be sent to my mail-id once the form is submitted.
